                <p class="p_1">Hook is a 1991 American fantasy adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and written
                    by
                    James V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo. It stars Robin Williams as Peter Banning / Peter Pan, Dustin
                    Hoffman as Captain Hook, Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, Bob Hoskins as Mr. Smee and Maggie Smith as
                    Granny Wendy. It acts as a sequel to J. M. Barrie's 1911 novel Peter and Wendy focusing on an adult
                    Peter Pan who has forgotten all about his childhood. In his new life, he is known as Peter Banning,
                    a successful but unimaginative and workaholic accountant with a wife (Wendy's granddaughter) and two
                    children. However, when Captain Hook, the enemy of his past, kidnaps his children, he returns to
                    Neverland to save them. Along the journey, he reclaims the memories of his past and becomes a better
                    person.

                <p class="p_2">The Genie is a fictional Jinn appearing in Walt Disney Pictures' 31st animated feature
                    film
                    Aladdin (1992). He was voiced by Robin Williams in the first film. Following a contract dispute
                    between Williams and the Walt Disney Company, Dan Castellaneta voiced the Genie throughout the
                    direct-to-video feature The Return of Jafar, as well as the television series, before Williams
                    reprised the role for the final installment, Aladdin and the King of Thieves, as well as for the
                    character's own mini-series, Great Minds Think for Themselves. Castellaneta voiced the Genie in
                    Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge and later the Kingdom Hearts series of video games by Square Enix and
                    Disney Interactive Studios for both Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II (with archived audio used
                    in other Kingdom Hearts games). Jim Meskimen took over the role in Disney Think Fast (2008) and
                    Kinect Disneyland Adventures (2011) and currently voices him, after Williams' death in 2014. Will
                    Smith plays a live-action version of the character in the 2019 live-action adaptation of the
                    original 1992 film.
