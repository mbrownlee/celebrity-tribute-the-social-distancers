                Robin's father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams, was a senior executive in Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division. His mother, Laurie McLaurin, was a former model from Jackson, Mississippi. He grew up in Illinois and Michigan. Williams had two elder half-brothers. Williams credited his mother as an important early influence on his humor, and he tried to make her laugh to gain attention. He described himself as a quiet child who did not overcome his shyness until he became involved with his high school drama department. His friends recall him as very funny. In 1973, Williams attained a full scholarship to the Juilliard School. His Juilliard classmate, Christopher Reeve remembered his first impression of Williams when they were new students at Juilliard: "He wore tie-dyed shirts with tracksuit bottoms and talked a mile a minute. I'd never seen so much energy contained in one person. He was like an untied balloon that had been inflated and immediately released. I watched in awe as he virtually caromed off the walls of the classrooms and hallways. To say that he was 'on' would be a major understatement." One of his teachers at Juilliard, said that Williams was a "genius" and that the school's conservative and classical style of training did not suit him; no one was surprised that he left in his junior year.

                Robin Williams married his first wife, Valerie Velardi, in June 1978. Their son Zachary Pym "Zak" Williams was born in 1983. Velardi and Williams were divorced in 1988. On April 30, 1989, Williams married Garces, Zak's former nanny, who was pregnant with his child. They had two children, Zelda Rae Williams and Cody Alan Williams. In March 2008, Garces filed for divorce from Williams, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in 2010. Williams married his third wife, graphic designer Susan Schneider, on October 22, 2011.

                Robin Williams struggled throughout his career with mental health issues. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Williams had an addiction to cocaine. The overdose deather of friend John Belushi, along with the birth of his own son Zak, prompted him to quit drugs and alcohol. Williams later said of Belushi's death, "It sobered the shit out of me." Williams turned to exercise and cycling to help alleviate his depression shortly after Belushi's death. Williams said, "cycling saved my life." n 2003, Williams started drinking again. In 2006, he checked himself in to a substance-abuse rehabilitation center, admitting he was an alcoholic. In mid-2014, Williams again admitted himself into the Hazelden Foundation Addiction Treatment Center for treatment for alcoholism. He was suffering from severe depression before his suicide death by hanging in August 2014. His wife, Susan Schneider, stated that in the period before his death, Williams had been sober, but was diagnosed with early stage Parkinson's disease. An autopsy revealed that Williams had diffuse Lewy body dementia. The early symptoms of his disease included a sudden and prolonged spike in fear and anxiety, stress and insomnia; which worsened in severity to include memory loss, paranoia, and delusions. According to Schneider, "Robin was losing his mind and he was aware of it ... He kept saying, 'I just want to reboot my brain.'"
