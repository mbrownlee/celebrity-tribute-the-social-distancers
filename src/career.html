        <p class="quoteText">"I left school and couldn't find acting work, so I started going to clubs where you could
            do stand-up. I've always improvised, and stand-up was this great release. All of a sudden, it was just me
            and the audience." - Robin Williams</p>

            <ul class="introList">
                <li>Williams got his start doing standup comedy in the San Francisco Bay Area in the mid 1970s.</li>
                <li>After moving to Los Angeles and continuing standup, Williams was approached by George Schlatter, a
                    producer who helped him get his start in Television.</li>
                <li>After his start in television, Williams went on to feature in the tremendously popular series Mork
                    and Mindy, a hugely popular spinoff of the series Happy Days.</li>
                <li>In 1977, Williams gained his first film credit, but did not star in a leading role until the 1980
                    film Popeye.</li>
                <li>After spending time in film and television, as well as continuing his stand-up comedy career, Robin
                    Williams starred in Good Morning, Vietnam, in which his script was almost entirely improvised. This
                    role is what truly brough him into the spotlight.</li>
